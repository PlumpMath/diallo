# Badges for Jenkins

Diallo is a small Compojure web application that displays 'badges' for your Jenkins jobs. It's
meant to be a coderwall-style view of your Jenkins setup, so you can easily spot where you
might be overlooking required plugins or settings.

## Usage

Clone the repository then...

```
lein run
```

You can then navigate to http://localhost:1234
